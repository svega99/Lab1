##Part I - Introduction to Java Threads
As reviewed in the readings, complete the CountThread classes, so that they define the life cycle of a thread that prints the numbers between A and B. 
Complete the main method of the CountMainThreads class so that: 
Create 3 threads of type CountThread, assigning the first one the interval [0..99], the second one [99..199], and the third one [200..299]. 
Start all three threads with start(). 
Run and check the output on screen. 
Change the beginning with start() to run(). How does the output change? Why?
